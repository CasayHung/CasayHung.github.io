                My name is Kai-Hsin Hung, a freshman in Department of Foreign Language and Literature of National Tsing Hua Universaty.<br><br> I was born in a mid-class family along with my triplet brother and sister. My parents are strict to me, and thus developed my sense of justice. Besides, I always do things I like at all costs, and enjoy the progress, regardless of the results. <br><br>  During the days in high school, I was overwhelmed by the stress caused by the competitive classmates and the high expectations from my parents and teachers. My grades started dropping dramatically. Soon, I had lost my passion for learning. <br><br>After having a good talk with my mother, I managed to put myself back together, and started rearranging my study plan for the big exam. I utilized my spare time to study. The results of the exam was still barely satisfactory, but just like what I’ve been saying, I always enjoy the progress, regardless of the results.
